* EmbedFile.zig

An extension to the Zig build system.
Its purpose is to enable a =build.zig= script author
to programmatically assemble a collection of assets, each of which is to be embedded with =@embedFile=,
into a module which can be included with =@import=.

To use in your =build.zig= scripts,
first add this project to your =build.zig.zon=, for example by running the following command

#+begin_src sh
  zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/robbielyman/EmbedFile.zig
#+end_src

Then in your =build.zig= you can do

#+begin_src zig
  const std = @import("std");
  const e = @import("embed-file");

  pub fn build(b: *std.Build) void {
      // both return a pointer of type *e.EmbedFile
      const embed_file = e.addEmbedFiles(b);
      const alignment: ?u29 = null;
      const embed_file_other = e.addEmbedFile("name", "contents", alignment);
      // ...
  }
#+end_src

This is the public API of an =EmbedFile= Step:

#+begin_src zig
  pub fn add(embed_file: *EmbedFile, name: []const u8, bytes: []const u8, alignment: ?u29) void {
      //...
  }

  pub fn addFile(
      embed_file: *EmbedFile,
      // this is a path to the parent directory of the file to be added
      source: std.Build.LazyPath,
      // this is the name of the file as it exists as input
      sub_path: []const u8,
      // this is the name which will be available when using the resulting Zig module
      name: []const u8,
      alignment: ?u29,
  ) void {
      //...
  }

  pub fn addDirectory(
      embed_file: *EmbedFile,
      // this is a path to the parent directory of the directory to be added
      source: std.Build.LazyPath,
      // this is the name of the directory as it exists as input
      sub_path: []const u8,
      // this allows the user to include or exclude files based on their extensions
      options: std.Build.Step.WriteFile.Directory.Options,
      // this is the namespace which will be available when using the resulting Zig module
      name: []const u8,
      // this alignment, if non-null, will be provided to all resulting `@embedFile` declarations
      // under this namespace
      alignment: ?u29,) void {
      //...
  }

  /// returns a `LazyPath` to the Zig source file generated from this `EmbedFile`
  pub fn getSource(embed_file: *EmbedFile) std.Build.LazyPath {
      // ...
  }

  /// returns a `Module` containing the Zig source file generated from this `EmbedFile`
  pub fn createModule(embed_file: *EmbedFile) *std.Build.Module {
      // ...
  }
#+end_src

To see an example of correct usage,
you can clone this repository and run =zig build test=.
The resulting Zig file will be placed in =test-output/module.zig= relative to the build prefix.
(NB: the resulting =module.zig= will not compile,
since its declarations use paths relative to a folder in the cache.)
